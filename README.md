# FrontEnd Assignment

Create a **Github Explorer** using the ðŸš€ Github API.

Here is a screenshot what the app should look like, with a better design, of course ðŸŽ¨.
(It's basic, feel free to improve it if you feel motivated ðŸ”¥ðŸ˜ŽðŸ”¥)

Here are the 2 required routes:

'**/** ' This landing page is supposed to display a search input to search for **Github Users**. You will also display here the search results.
'**/:user/repos**' Display here repos of the user

Here are the 2 endpoints you will need. (Feel free to use more of their API) 
  
[https://api.github.com/search/users?q={SEARCH_TERM}](https://api.github.com/search/users?q=%7BSEARCH_TERM%7D)  
[https://api.github.com/users/{USERNAME}/repos](https://api.github.com/search/users?q=%7BSEARCH_TERM%7D)  

As you can see, what we ask you to do is pretty simple. We still want to check how you would use NgRx to handle state management of the app.
**Build your Store** inside the Core Module to handle loading state, store results, get route parameters, etc. 

We appreciate clean & scalable code. If you don't have much time, keep the app simple and write quality code ðŸ™‚.
UI isn't really mandatory here but we appreciate cool design and clean CSS. You can use Angular Material to build your interface faster.

You may use any library/ framework you like and deem suitable for this assignment.
 
## Submission 
A **Github repo** with the project.
We feel like 3 hours is enough to do this assignment.
Be sure to show us all your knowledge ðŸ˜Ž
